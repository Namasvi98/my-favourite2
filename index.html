        <p>My hobby is reading Harry Potter almost all the time. I have finished reading it for the tenth time. The things I love about it are- Adventure,You never know what comes next,Magic and their bravery those are all the reasons I like it. And it is true if I do not read for two whole days in a row then I will not be my normal self. And if I read too much my head will start to hurt.</p>
